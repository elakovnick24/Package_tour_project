## _The list of tools used with the justification of the choice_

* Java 8 - the language for writing auto-tests, the most reliable version
* Gradle - build automation and dependency management system
* JUnit is a platform for writing autoâ€”tests and running them 
* Selenide is a framework for automated testing of web applications based on Selenium WebDriver, more convenient and easy to use than Selenium
* Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to run multi-container applications, so as not to install Node applications necessary for operation on your computer.js and DBMS
* Allure is a framework designed to create reports that are more visual than Gradle

## _The list and description of possible risks in automation_
* Due to the lack of technical specifications and any documentation, it is difficult to understand how the application should work and what system behavior should be considered an error
* The real system and real data are likely to be different from the SUT and test data, and test automation may be useless
* Using third-party libraries and frameworks may increase the risk of technical problems
* Possible problems due to the need to support two DBMS (MySQL, Postgres)
* The absence of test_id complicates the writing and support of tests

## _interval assessment taking into account risks (in hours)_
